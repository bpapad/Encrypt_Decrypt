# Encrypt_Decrypt
A program written in C which runs on CMD encrypting and decrypting any file provided, using a key inserted by the user.

Any file can be morphed into any form (.exe, .mp3, .whatever) and can be changed back in its original form and be run as usual as long as the provided key in both cases is the same.
